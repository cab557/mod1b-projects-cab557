 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
I made the Ikea Ball Pit with the mechanics in mind of being a simulation of a children's ball pit. The mechanics reflect player's movement before the balls starts to spawn versus after. The dynamics are the balls dropping over time until they are filled to a "safe" level for the player to move and see. I want players to feel nostalgic after playing because this game was prompted from a childhood memory of being dropped off at the ball pit while my family shops at Ikea.
